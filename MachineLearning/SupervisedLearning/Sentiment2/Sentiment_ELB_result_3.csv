I missed the last one.  @itsSamaraMorgan Gosh, no need to be so rude.  @innuendogirl No long catch-up post on tvDOT? I was looking forward to one.  @buffyTVSrox @othertv.compeople I never know the movies you guys talk about.  @Unusual_Peanut OMG I LOVED The Uninvited! That movie was AMAZING! I wanted to buy it today, but the DVD cost too much money.  I think my allergies are acting up and I need to blow my nose, but I can't find any tissues.  @Unusual_Peanut I don't know, I have a headache and I realize that I'm not making much sense.  @innuendogirl My computer froze because of that open office thing. I have to use my other computer and tv.com is blocked on here.  @JenJelly85 I got really mad at my brother because he was being annoying, so I slammed the lid on the computer. And it broke.  @JenJelly85 to get online anymore.  @JenJelly85 people on tv.com right now? I hate missing so many posts.  @JenJelly85 I guess it doesn't matter much anyway coz if it takes long to get fixed I can't read all the posts anyway. This really sucks.  @Unusual_Peanut I don't think so! Why did you change your bio/name? I liked your old one better.  @Unusual_Peanut I get spoiled about everything. Grr.  @JenJelly85 But mp3.com and gamespot still work, so I can read/comment blogs on there, but not much else.  @DanWarp yFrog is blocked on my computer (I have no idea why), so I can't see the pics.  @Unusual_Peanut Why aren't you on the DLPW? It was so active a minute ago and now it's dead. I might leave if no one posts.  @buffyTVSrox @Unusual_Peanut @jason_isaacs Why is no one at the Dollhouse LPW?  @JenJelly85 I'm having a horrible day.  You? @AdellesLover The DOTT is dead, remember? It's the &quot;DLPW&quot; now.  @JenJelly85 Yeah, I remember you saying that in a blog. That sucks.  I would hate to get 0 presents. Mostly for birthdays I get DVDs and @JenJelly85 I always get my friends their presents on time.But last year both of my friends forgot it was my bday,so I got my gifts late.  I never thought I would say this, but I have decided that Milo Ventimiglia is NOT my favorite actor anymore.  @Unusual_Peanut @AdellesLover I will do anything for someone to give me a ship! I don't like being left out of the shipiness.  @Unusual_Peanut Hmmm...Tempting, but no. I've told you things via PM before and you always hold it against me.  @JennetteMcCTeam I actually guessed that, but my tweet didn't go through.  Oh well, I'll get the next one.  @innuendogirl I know. I never have anything to do, so I create arguments over nothing. My life sucks.  @innuendogirl celebrities and TV characters, so it's no big deal. I can't save anything to my comp. cuz I'm using the school one.   @Unusual_Peanut I have no idea what that link was for cuz it's blocked on my computer.  @Unusual_Peanut You're a jerk (re. blocking).  @Unusual_Peanut What? I didn't say anything mean to @innuendogirl! And that wasn't a low blow. That was just...Evil.  @Unusual_Peanut But your joke wasn't funny.  @Unusual_Peanut Why not?  Dammit, the Penguins lost the game tonight. Only sport I actually care about and my team loses.  @jason_isaacs I like tennis too, but I don't really follow it. Sorry about your player losing.  @Unusual_Peanut Why are you trying so hard to avoid the DLPW? It's so dead and I have no one to talk to.  Please post! Please! Please! @Unusual_Peanut posts right now coz it's no fun if you're not trying. Takes the fun out of the competition.  @Unusual_Peanut But it's still not the same if you don't post as much. You're a fun sucker. You suck the fun out of everything.  @innuendogirl BTW what do you mean I still have a way to go?  I'm already awesome enough.  @Unusual_Peanut This is no fair! I never get credit for anything! I did NOT look it up!  @innuendogirl Grr the trending topics keeping changing!  @innuendogirl NO. I'm still on season 3.  And that list was jank. Red from That '70s Show should have been #1! The VM dad should be #15. @innuendogirl It's OK.  I can't really judge if he should be #1 or not since I haven't seen the show, but some of those people should have @Unusual_Peanut It's because people have accepted that Brucas won't happen.  Post negative things in the Seddie thread for iCarly.  @buffyTVSrox I need to go to that. *dies at thought of going* It's probably a ton of money though.  @innuendogirl Every time I hear the word minion it reminds me of Harmony. Harmony is awesome.  And the squirrel isn't evil.  @innuendogirl Harmony's not a tag-along.  There was an episode where she got minions. Can't remember which one though. :/ @innuendogirl Harmony should have been in more episodes. I know she's going to be on Angel, but I'm only on S3, so it will be a while.  @halesbells Haha sorry about the gym.  @Unusual_Peanut Me too. I'm almost always bored out of my mind though.  @Unusual_Peanut There's not much I can do w/o the LPW coz of my computer.  We should bring the DLPW back to life.  @Megan_Park I've been trying to watch it since it started at 8, but my family keeps yelling and I can't hear it.  I've been trying to watch The Secret Life for the past 2 hours, but so far have only been able to watch about 12 minutes.  @jason_isaacs Hey! What's that supposed to mean?  @celineyme Just so you know, @OfficialTL is a confirmed fake account.  @simoncurtis Best of luck with that! Can't wait to hear more about it! And I'm excited for your HM episode!  @simoncurtis YES I AM SO EXCITED! I CAN NOTWAIT FOR YOUR EPISODE OF HM! IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME!  @Unusual_Peanut @spikemaniac Good point. Then I will kill @innuendogirl so I can have @jessstroup and @jesslowndes all to myself.  @Miss_Elenious I heard that Drag Me To Hell is really good. I'm hoping to see it sometime soon. Have fun at the movies!  Is it weird that right now I'm wearing 3D glasses that I got from the movies months ago?  These 3D glasses are awesome. They make everything so dark tinted.  Nevermind, I found a paper towel to use! Yay!  @misscracker The movie was actually kind of boring. I only liked it because of Jensen Ackles.  @jessstroup Have fun!  @Unusual_Peanut Who needs cute and bubbly when you can have gorey and scary?  @Unusual_Peanut Right, I forgot Doug changed his too. His icon is awesome.  @dannygokey Upload them onto the computer, then go to twitpic.com. It shouldn't be that hard.  Going to bed now. Goodnight.  @Megan_Park I love that song! I'm going to a Taylor Swift concert in August!  @charlottedotcom I know! I'm so excited! NPH is awesome!  @AdellesLover I don't think so. I still have my innocence.  @iGix YAY! HAVE FUN!  @innuendogirl The show is developing. Of course it's not the same as it was in the beginning. That would just be boring.  @JennetteMcCTeam I actually guessed that, but my tweet didn't go through.  Oh well, I'll get the next one.  @dvldb Nighty night.
