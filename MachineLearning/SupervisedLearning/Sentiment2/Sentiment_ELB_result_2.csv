No comments! WHY? 'coz he used Disqus  And @Disqus doesn't have a public API   That sucks  Drooling at the xkcd store. I'd buy it, if only shipping wasn't as expensive  @geekgyan This is the first time someone has stolen something from me mate. Sucks big time. Hurts big time  Writing code. Can't tear myself away. I have a semester exam tomorrow. AND I DONNO CRAP  @fossiloflife Oh, I didn't read your tweet. My humor detector is broken  Well, I was hoping to make the new app IronPython compatible too. Oh well  The internet is as old as me. Not bad, eh? It's managed to do way more than me  @jaskirat Most of the time, the Parents *AND* the students don't know how bad it is. A friend of a friend just paid 9 lakhs for JPR  #sad @chrisnixon Cut down on the FriendFeed noise a bit, matey? Last.fm polluting Twitter  @fossiloflife They can always just not do anything, and the news agencies will move on. Like how the JPR issue was dropped all at once!  @aravindkumar I thought it was a convo between you and @msnarain till I got to the &quot;WHO CARES&quot; part. My C&amp;H is a little rusty  Erratic Power patterns. This ain't good  Dear Cricinfo - Your Page 2 stuff is pretty crap  @Sengupta Maybe that explains it. Our syllabus for most stuff (esp. CS) is shit here  @karmanya None of them would attend  @Thor_ Movies? Traumatic? I have 40k photos and videos - memories from School and College.

Sad thing is, both sets of parents are there too  Damn, me and @msnarain couldn't get the #novelrace web site done by yesterday night  Guess it'll have to wait till after my exams are over @vimalg2 But I'm still writing code  Can't tear myself away  @sudhamshu No, I'm at home, messaging friends and trying to study for tomorrow's exam  Vaaranam Aiyram releasing around this time would've been PERFECT  @Iyertalks @rtshiva Well, I don't have a choice - They took tickets for Masillamani.

And yeah, the ugly git in the profile pic is me   Okay, stopped watching the match, came down and put on Last.fm  @fossiloflife Well, it isn't must for me - I could always hang up my boots and say i'm not doing it. But I like doing it  @Whacky /me refuses to get into a philosophical argument. Nobody wins those  @Whacky Passed it on to him  @fossiloflife Yup  Y'know, I'm getting myself an XBox 360. When Natal ships  I think I'll migrate from Wordpress to a custom built static-styled blog cms  @sudarmuthu  @voyagerfan5761 'coz I like composing my blogposts in Markdown using Vim, having my posts served up FAST, with minimal server load  @Whacky Theory doesn't pulverize people mate, it's the people who teach that that pulverize it. I learn stuff from books, not 'teachers'  @Karthik And IIRC, he also has permission from the government  Dependencies so far - nose, unittest, jinja2  @fossiloflife Maybe  I did lose 20kg once I joined my college  @surajram But seriously, there is no better measure of code quality than &quot;WTF&quot;s/min  @rads The numbers are printed small for a reason. Maximum utilization of space  @msnarain @sudhamshu Considering most people enjoy most music from their late teens-early twenties, that puts @msdnarain at around 50!  @rampantheart HiSlain isn't for everyone - it means you've to compose blog posts on a text editor (vim/emacs/notepad!) - no GUI at all  @Sengupta @krist0ph3r 4 Hours is more like what happened last time. I don't want to repeat that again  @ZoliErdos Yup  I'm working on finishing a blogging system in the meantime  It's 2:30 AM here, and I'm coding! @Sengupta Yup  That's why I've been writing code - a bunch of cool code at Github &gt; 'Course Completed' certificate ;) Never trust untrustworthy people  @kr8tr That's right about the temp here  @jaskirat So it's going to be a 500 + 250 + 1 TB for me  @srukrish I'll be free for a couple hours tomorrow evening, before diving into EDC.
