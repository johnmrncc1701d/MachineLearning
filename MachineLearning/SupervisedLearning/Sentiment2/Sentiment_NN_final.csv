NO CLOSED CAPTIONS for this ad  Spike will be showing &quot;FIGHT CLUB&quot; and some great quotes about how it was originally received are provided, but not captioned.  A great commercial for New Era Caps - that features no so great absence of Closed Captioning.  A rapping, bustling cab full of drunk people showcases Heineken, that features no closed captioning.  Drink up! Bridgestone features a commercial talking about &quot;breaking boundaries&quot; that apparently doesn't include the Deaf/Hard of Hearing - no caps  Tempuerpedic provides some great looking details, but all of the dialog in the commercial comes (drumroll) without any closed captioning  ",-1,-1,MATCH

Can the Cavs come back from a 16 point deficit? I am not so sure.  So it is a Lakers/Cavs series...damn...I don't like Dwight Howard.  @johnnatn How cool!
