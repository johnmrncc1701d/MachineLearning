"Rereading the first chapters of my favourite (WIP) fic. Waiting for updates is such a drag and I'm running out of chs to reread  I have 1 week to catch up on 11 weeks of French work  the only bad thing about my fav. fic is that it's forced me to realise how terrible all of the other fics I like are  my twitsymmetry just died  @babydykecate I'm so excited for the finale. I have to wait until tonight, though due to internet restraints  I love learning new words, but by the time I've put the dictionary away, I've usually forgotten the fucking thing  going to go watch Heroes. really fucking tired. probably won't make it the whole way through. bollocks 7am start  Apparently, the HUGE clouds are coming very soon  @cassiehl Well, apparently, my Xbox is at the house of someone called Sol, who I'm pretty sure I've never met, so I can't play either  waiting for Facebook to load. Slow internet is the worst  correcting someone's French on Facebook! I'm just trying to help, but I feel kind of horrible  I really want Michelle Ryan to be the next companion  With David Tennant of course! Forgot to remind @paperclipface to bring the next Dark Tower book for me tomorrow  I have run out of strange conversations  @paperclipface good, good! I bet yours doesn't suck as much as mine, though! I wrote my 1st fight scene; my charries usually run away  Exactly 3050 words! finished just before midnight. Not a bad days work. The enthusiasm never lasts, though; It's all down hill from here  Potential Muslim school in Sydney has been disapproved  @paperclipface congrats. I still haven't finished organising my tags. My system is too complicated  grrr. must wash dishes  @paperclipface I've been waiting forever for them to have S1 of L word or Deadwood and they had both today; I had to choose  @paperclipface I just don't understand people  SuWriMo: 14,500/75,000 words. got nothing done today  just watched a doco about grizzly bears in Russia. It lulled me into a false sense of security then ripped my heart out and stomped on it  my stomach really hurts. I think I should eat something; I've had nothing but a bite of toast since lunch-time Saturday  just slept for 3 1/2 hours and now I can't sleep anymore  I just drank tea without eating and now I feel sick too  This has not been my week. My stomach feels very strange; definitely shouldn't have eaten last night  I saw something funny today that I wanted to post to wrongworddammit, but I can't remember what it was  must go wash dishes  On Google Maps. Just found the house I used to live in. I think I shall take a photo of it.  I miss London  and Angie  should probably go to bed soon. apparently, I actually have to do school work on my day off  I've read the book twice and understood it perfectly well, yet I have absolutely no idea what's happening in the tv adaptation!  my firefox just crashed. I wasn't even doing anything  @paperclipface Also, I don't know my way around Africa  just found out that my favourite fic only has 2 chapters left  Being a strong female character is definitely not easy in fandom  @cassiehl I'm always doing things like that. I think &quot;I'll put the work into this one and make it nice,&quot; but it never works out  Good luck My dad is at a funeral  I miss all my not-here-at-the-moment-somewhere-else-instead friends and wish that they were here at the moment instead of somewhere else  I'm really hungry; dinner isn't for another 4hrs  @paperclipface it's okay; she's fine. I terrified her, though, and she jumped and startled me and I jumped and hit my head on a table  going to go wash the dishes now. I had wanted to read some Harry Potter before bed, but I don't think I have time  oh, well. Grey's Anatomy made me cry  I would very much like escargot right now! w/ garlic butter or with salt and cinnamon  *sigh* where's my grandmother when I need her? Surprisingly,  I think I shall write. I'm getting excited; I'm actually about to introduce a SECOND charrie. I can finally have dialogue  making cous cous- stuffed capsicums (peppers) for dinner  also, I cooked the food I ate.
