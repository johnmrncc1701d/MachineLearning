A great commercial for New Era Caps - that features no so great absence of Closed Captioning.  A rapping, bustling cab full of drunk people showcases Heineken, that features no closed captioning.  Drink up! Bridgestone features a commercial talking about &quot;breaking boundaries&quot; that apparently doesn't include the Deaf/Hard of Hearing - no caps  Tempuerpedic provides some great looking details, but all of the dialog in the commercial comes (drumroll) without any closed captioning  ",-1,-1,MATCH

Can the Cavs come back from a 16 point deficit? I am not so sure.  So it is a Lakers/Cavs series...damn...I don't like Dwight Howard.  @johnnatn How cool!

Back from the run...was able to run 3 miles instead of 2. Feeling quite proud of myself.  @NKOTBahamas2009 I heard is at the very end. I haven't checked my Tivo.  @JaimeMcKnight You need your rest Jaime! You had a very eventful day. Go to sleep and dream about that moment again. Enjoy it!
