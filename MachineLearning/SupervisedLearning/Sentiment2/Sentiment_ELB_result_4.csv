"Omg, it's 7:30AM! I haven't been up this early since college let out.  Alas, one AWESOME day off with VFC, and then it's straight back to work.  And dang it, it's sunny out today!  Ship. I'm stuck.  Church went good today. I missed it.  I used to go every Sunday, but stopped for some reason. :l Sweet geez, my internet was down for 5 hours.  Nighty-night, everyone! My 2 days off went by waaayyy too fast!  your old character and then you forget that your not that old character anymore! That was a really long rant for &quot;I just lost the game.&quot;  @VarsityFC Holy sheesh, when you guys say &quot;tomorrow&quot;, you don't fool around. Merch up by 1AM Eastern Time, and me with no credit card.  @VARSITYFC When does the new merchandise go up? Did I miss it?  The Internet won't work on my laptop for some reason. AHH!  Sooo behind on reading people's twitters. Forced to use the regular comp. I think my whole body aches. I was pretty lazy @ work tonight, something that NEVER happens.  Three days in a row was a killer. I really need to check my e-mail for Niagara University everyday. Grrr. Lotta things I need to read.  Gas prices go up everyday. YAY GOVERNMENT!  You suck, New York State. Penguins' Victory Parade highlights on TV. Makes me sad.  You would think if I continue to block someone, despite the fact they are under a new username each time, I DON'T want them following me!  Time to go.  I will tell you how it went around 1, if I make it home. :l Time for bed. Not feeling too hot right now.  Everyone needs to wish @drewryanscott a &quot;Happy 21st Birthday!&quot; I think I smell like a french fry, and I'm not even @ work yet!  Crap, lost my train of thought.  I took a 2 hour nap today, so now I'm wide awake.  Whoop! Whoop! 3 pages! YAY, BABY! Only 2 more to go.  Shortening paragraphs. Genius.  Now onto the fifth page.
