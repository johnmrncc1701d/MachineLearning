The reason being my college at Dubai. I'm in Chennai at the moment.  @just_reva I realized that looking at your album now with just you in it. #TheFarm  @kadambariyer meaning garland of flowers, which flora should I rest on your grave?  @polka_ Good Afternoon Lady! I feel sorry abt the demise of your Grandaunt!  @rehna_tu I'd been waitin' for your return to knock on my twitter door.  Twitterville is so gonna miss its Sunny Babe @tarushikha for long time now.  Off all the times I've travelled abroad, there is not even a single instance where my check-in baggage have reached early. My fate.  @varunshridhar: I'm not silent. It's the high GPRS roaming charges that restricts me from tweeting.  @rohitsabu: The sea shell restaurant in Chennai spoilt my taste bud for Shawarma &amp; Falafel.  #Fail @AiyerChitra @CreativeWolf : Gratias! It ended up being 'Vaaidaa'. Defendants failed to show up.  @shaaqT: Unfortunately you are 5 years elder to me. Sigh!  @rohitsabu: 'Yankee Doodle' is what runs on my head.  #Fail @vishnupsp: I want SUPREME scripted in Malayalam, not the translation buddy.  Holy Cow! The iPhone OS 3.0 upgrade wiped off all my existing applications.  @AiyerChitra: I spoke with ABT Maruti. They have put me on the waiting list for the next 2 months due to heavy demand.  #Swift @bharathy_99: I'd prefer the Honda Jazz if alone the price tag was feasible.  @bharathy_99: Jazz in India is just Honda strategy to prove they can make affordable cars for the working class. It still doesn't fit me.  @javashri: It's all in the game. 2009 has totally filled me with losses. CSK, ChelseaFC &amp; now Spain.  @sukidivine Nothin' pal. Just bullyin' @ajitmoses. He is actually a very distant relative of mine.  All is fine down here @sudhamshu. My day totally seems incomplete without Tweets these days.  Thank you @konterfai_rss for the #sundayhug &amp; here is my hypothetical hug back to you.  @varunshridhar Dude! Can't you be a little more careful. Take care brother.  @thenewbnb It sure is. Amazon is throwin' in great deals to clear out the stock.  @teknotrise 'iPod for Dummies'?? What more can the book teach apart from joggin' the wheel &amp; clicks.  @ajitmoses Where in Madurai is ur grandmom at? Let's tweetup @ Konar Mess.  #KariDosai @AiyerChitra Conan can never match Jay Leno in spite of being a comedian by profession. Let's see how good he makes his debut on Monday.  I feel content for the day havin' put a smile on @polka_ with my tweet.  Chelsea wins the FA Cup. Finally a time I cheer for made me proud.  #FACupFinal @gulpanag How long did u do ur schooling in Wellington? Does that give u a Tamil fluency?? I'm curious.  @aravindkumar GFY! Don't Bing it. Google it.  I have @JennAnnis to bail me out if I get arrested in the middle of the night. Proud of you pal.  @thenewbnb The bus is moving. It is so much fun. I feel a roller-coaster ride leaving me to tweet bouncingly.  @aravindkumar Maybe! I've not even listened to John Denver's version apart from the mentioned both.  @varunshridhar Cheers! This calls for twarty when you head to India. Don't forget to get Fosters for @aravindkumar. Australian for beer.  My iPhone is going exhausted without charge. So I'll return later having put her to rest. AdiÃ³s Amigos.  @far1983 Machan! Is it the beer day or it is you being high to tweet beer quotes?  @preethzzz: I just have a toe stepped in Orkut to be connected with all my school-mates. Facebook is more of what defines me actually.  I offered my computer a sandwich today. It took a Megabyte.  Food, Party &amp; Treat are the keywords to wake up @rohitsabu, @lone_observer &amp; @adapaavi respectively along the twitter timeline. AWESOME!  @Lhjunkie: So what's the agenda for the day apart from working out.  @fossiloflife: Googled it. Geely CE is it's name. Â£30,000 for the luxury of Â£271,000 worth Phantom.
