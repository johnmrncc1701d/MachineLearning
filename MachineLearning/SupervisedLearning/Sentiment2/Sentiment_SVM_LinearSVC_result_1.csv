"Rereading the first chapters of my favourite (WIP) fic. Waiting for updates is such a drag and I'm running out of chs to reread  I have 1 week to catch up on 11 weeks of French work  the only bad thing about my fav. fic is that it's forced me to realise how terrible all of the other fics I like are  my twitsymmetry just died  @babydykecate I'm so excited for the finale. I have to wait until tonight, though due to internet restraints  I love learning new words, but by the time I've put the dictionary away, I've usually forgotten the fucking thing  going to go watch Heroes. really fucking tired. probably won't make it the whole way through. bollocks 7am start  Apparently, the HUGE clouds are coming very soon  @cassiehl Well, apparently, my Xbox is at the house of someone called Sol, who I'm pretty sure I've never met, so I can't play either  waiting for Facebook to load. Slow internet is the worst  correcting someone's French on Facebook! I'm just trying to help, but I feel kind of horrible  I really want Michelle Ryan to be the next companion  With David Tennant of course! Forgot to remind @paperclipface to bring the next Dark Tower book for me tomorrow  I have run out of strange conversations  @paperclipface good, good! I bet yours doesn't suck as much as mine, though! I wrote my 1st fight scene; my charries usually run away  Exactly 3050 words! finished just before midnight. Not a bad days work. The enthusiasm never lasts, though; It's all down hill from here  Potential Muslim school in Sydney has been disapproved  @paperclipface congrats. I still haven't finished organising my tags. My system is too complicated  grrr. must wash dishes  @paperclipface I've been waiting forever for them to have S1 of L word or Deadwood and they had both today; I had to choose  @paperclipface I just don't understand people  SuWriMo: 14,500/75,000 words. got nothing done today  just watched a doco about grizzly bears in Russia. It lulled me into a false sense of security then ripped my heart out and stomped on it  my stomach really hurts. I think I should eat something; I've had nothing but a bite of toast since lunch-time Saturday  just slept for 3 1/2 hours and now I can't sleep anymore  I just drank tea without eating and now I feel sick too  This has not been my week. My stomach feels very strange; definitely shouldn't have eaten last night  I saw something funny today that I wanted to post to wrongworddammit, but I can't remember what it was  must go wash dishes  On Google Maps. Just found the house I used to live in. I think I shall take a photo of it.  I miss London  and Angie  should probably go to bed soon. apparently, I actually have to do school work on my day off  I've read the book twice and understood it perfectly well, yet I have absolutely no idea what's happening in the tv adaptation!  my firefox just crashed. I wasn't even doing anything  @paperclipface Also, I don't know my way around Africa  just found out that my favourite fic only has 2 chapters left  Being a strong female character is definitely not easy in fandom  @cassiehl I'm always doing things like that. I think &quot;I'll put the work into this one and make it nice,&quot; but it never works out  Good luck My dad is at a funeral  I miss all my not-here-at-the-moment-somewhere-else-instead friends and wish that they were here at the moment instead of somewhere else  I'm really hungry; dinner isn't for another 4hrs  @paperclipface it's okay; she's fine. I terrified her, though, and she jumped and startled me and I jumped and hit my head on a table  going to go wash the dishes now. I had wanted to read some Harry Potter before bed, but I don't think I have time  oh, well. Grey's Anatomy made me cry  I would very much like escargot right now! w/ garlic butter or with salt and cinnamon  *sigh* where's my grandmother when I need her? Surprisingly,  I think I shall write. I'm getting excited; I'm actually about to introduce a SECOND charrie. I can finally have dialogue  making cous cous- stuffed capsicums (peppers) for dinner  also, I cooked the food I ate.

I tend to get in a slump when its like this  New blog post http://www.drawingfreak.com FINALLY finished the recent freelance gig I have been working on, woot! Well mostly  Gotta admit, I dig Bing. Really like the way you can search &amp; watch videos in the search engine. They need to make a bar for it though  I don't know why I keep buying games.

You feel old. I was like 27 when that came out. Thanks for putting it all in perspective for this old codger  Hehe Man it's a beautiful sunny day today. I am going to have to get out in it. It was 100 degrees yesterday and I was in all day  G'day tweeps It would appear that Demigod fucked me. After restarting my comp about an hour ago I had to run repair disk. Demigod no longer works now  @FirstDigg Whats it for. I'm outta the loop. As usual  Friday's comic is on the way, working on it now. Sorry for the non-midnight update  DAMMMITTTT! That last tweet was my 1000th and I used it for shitty advertising. /cry  Ok, patching on WoW done now, trying to play. Why do I feel dirty all of a sudden  Ok, imma play some WoW now. Since I have been gone from it for a few months I need to respec my warrior now.  Nice, 2/3 the way through making dinner and I realize I do not have a vital part of it. Gotta go to the store now  @dcorsetto I love how that little space between the two at the bottom of the last panel tells the joke, nice  Ugh, woke up to an apartment that was 80 degrees. Now my AC will run for the entire day again I am sure. Anyway, its the weekend so woot!  Spent the entire day drawing comic strips, got three point five of them done. Tomorrow has to be freelance and clean apartment day. Gnite  Great, my foot hurts again and I don't really know why this time. Plus I ate too much and now I am fat and tired, well I'm always fat  I deem today Naked Monday http://www.drunkduck.com/Robot_Friday/ Am I REALLY participating? I will let your mind's fantisize.  Nothing like drawing a character over and over again over a couple of days and looking at the evolution to where you really dig it  Well I'm going to bed and trying it all out tomorrow. Night tweeps  I'm not complaining, mind you, just stating a fact about my day  So it hasn't been a bad day. Now I gotta get a comic done  @brainhound You're very right there.
